# ScanScripts

This is a collection of tools that I use for almost every PDF file I create

The following are Windows, Linux shell scripts might come at a later date if I or someone else care to write these.

Required installs for these scripts are IrfanView, ImageMagick (version 6), PDF Toolkit, xpdf (pdftotext), PHP (5.6) CLI
The versions have been testet, newer versions aren't tested
