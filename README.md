# ScanScripts

This is a collection of tools that I use for almost every PDF file I create

The following are Windows, Linux shell scripts might come at a later date if I or someone else care to write these.

Required installs for these scripts are IrfanView, ImageMagick (version 6), PDF Toolkit, PHP (5.6) CLI
The versions have been testet, newer versions aren't tested
