# ScanScripts

This is a collection of tools that I use for almost every PDF file I create

The following are Windows, Linux shell scripts might come at a later date if I or someone else care to write these.

Required installs for these scripts are IrfanView, ImageMagick (version 6), PDF Toolkit, xpdf (pdftotext), PHP (5.6) CLI
The versions have been testet, newer versions aren't tested

https://imagemagick.org/download/windows/ (grab the latest of version 6)

https://windows.php.net/download#php-5.6

https://www.xpdfreader.com/pdftotext-man.html (Xpdf command line tools)


Make sure all the CLI tools are in your path environment.

php5.exe, php5.dll are the only things needed from the php package.


You may need to edit the files to fit your installation accordingly, i.e. path to irfanview etc.
